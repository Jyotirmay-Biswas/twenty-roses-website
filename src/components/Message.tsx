                To the love of my life,
              </p>
              <p>
                Happy Birthday, my sweetheart. <br />
                Today should've started with smiles, warmth, and love â€” and I'm so deeply sorry that I forgot your special day. I know how much your birthday means, and I can't express how badly I wish I could go back in time and make it right. Please know this from my heart: this will never happen again.
              </p>
              <p>
                Your kindness, your strength, your laughter, and even your little quirks that only I get to see - every part of you has made my life infinitely better. The way you love, the way you care, and the way you make our house a home fills me with gratitude every single day.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today is all about celebrating YOU - the incredible person you are and all the amazing things you've yet to do. The world is lucky to have you, and I'm the luckiest of all to call you mine.
              </p>
              <p>
                Happy 20th birthday, my love. Here's to many more birthdays together, many more adventures, many more quiet moments, and many more reasons to celebrate this beautiful life we're building together.
              </p>
